## 1. Comprehensive Guide to Using the Load Tester Application

### Overview

The Load Tester application is a powerful tool for simulating user traffic to websites and web applications. It allows you to:

1. Create simple URL-based load tests
2. Create complex user journey-based tests
3. Mix multiple journeys in a single test
4. Assign tests to other users
5. Create and share public test templates


### Key Features

- **Simple URL Tests**: Test a single endpoint with configurable parameters
- **User Journeys**: Create multi-step user flows that simulate real user behavior
- **Multiple Journeys**: Combine multiple journeys in a single test with configurable probability
- **Realistic User Simulation**: Simulates human-like behavior with natural timing and user agent rotation
- **Detailed Results**: View comprehensive test results including response times, success rates, and per-user metrics
- **Public Templates**: Share test configurations with other users
- **Test Assignment**: Assign tests to specific users for collaboration


### Setting Up Your First Test

#### Simple URL Test

1. **Navigate to the Dashboard**: Go to the main dashboard page
2. **Create a New Test**: Click the "Create New Test" button
3. **Configure Basic Settings**:

1. Enter a descriptive name for your test
2. Enter the target URL (e.g., [https://example.com](https://example.com))
3. Leave the "User Journey" field empty
4. Set the number of virtual users (e.g., 10)
5. Set the spawn rate (users per second, e.g., 1)
6. Set the test duration in seconds (e.g., 60)
7. Select the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)



4. **Configure Advanced Settings** (optional):

1. Add HTTP headers in JSON format (e.g., `{"Content-Type": "application/json"}`)
2. Add a request body for POST/PUT requests



5. **Create the Test**: Click the "Create Test" button
6. **Run the Test**: From the test details page, click the "Run Test" button


#### User Journey Test

1. **Create a User Journey**:

1. Go to the "Journeys" section and click "Create New Journey"
2. Enter a name and description for the journey
3. Enter the base URL (e.g., [https://example.com](https://example.com))
4. Add steps to the journey (see below)



2. **Create a Test with the Journey**:

1. Create a new test as above, but select your journey from the dropdown
2. You can leave the target URL empty when using a journey



3. **Run the Test**: From the test details page, click the "Run Test" button


#### Creating Journey Steps

A journey consists of multiple steps that simulate user actions:

1. **Navigate**: Go to a specific URL (can be relative to the base URL)

1. URL: The path to navigate to (e.g., `/login`)



2. **Click**: Simulate clicking on an element

1. Selector: CSS selector for the element (e.g., `#submit-button`)



3. **Input**: Enter text into a form field

1. Selector: CSS selector for the input field (e.g., `#username`)
2. Value: Text to enter (e.g., `testuser`)



4. **Submit**: Submit a form

1. Selector: CSS selector for the form (e.g., `#login-form`)



5. **Wait**: Pause for a specified time

1. Min/Max Wait: Time range in seconds





For each step, you can configure:

- Min Wait: Minimum time to wait before executing the step
- Max Wait: Maximum time to wait before executing the step


### Using Multiple Journeys

1. **Create Multiple Journeys**: Create several different user journeys
2. **Create a Test with Multiple Journeys**:

1. Create a new test
2. Select a primary journey (optional)
3. In the "Additional User Journeys" field, select multiple journeys (hold Ctrl/Cmd to select multiple)
4. Set the "Journey Probability" (0-1) to control how often journeys are used vs. the target URL



3. **Run the Test**: The virtual users will randomly select from the available journeys based on the probability


### Public Templates

Public templates allow you to share your test configurations with other users:

1. **Create a Public Template**:

1. Create a test as normal
2. From the test details page, click "Make Public Template"
3. Enter a name and description for the template



2. **Use a Public Template**:

1. Go to the "Public Templates" section
2. Browse available templates
3. Click "Clone Template" on the template you want to use
4. The template will be copied to your tests with your ownership





### Test Assignment

You can assign tests to other users for collaboration:

1. **Assign a Test**:

1. From the test details page, click "Assign Test"
2. Select the user(s) you want to assign the test to
3. Click "Assign"



2. **View Assigned Tests**:

1. Assigned tests appear in the "Assigned Tests" section of your dashboard
2. You can view, run, and clone assigned tests
3. You cannot delete or edit tests assigned to you unless you're the owner





### Analyzing Test Results

After running a test, you can view detailed results:

1. **Summary Statistics**:

1. Total requests
2. Success rate
3. Average response time
4. Requests per second



2. **Virtual Users Summary**:

1. Performance metrics for each virtual user
2. Success rates per user



3. **Detailed Results**:

1. Individual request results
2. Response times
3. Status codes
4. Errors



4. **Journey Analysis** (for journey tests):

1. Performance metrics for each journey
2. Success rates per journey step
3. Bottlenecks in the user flow





### Implementing IP Rotation/Proxies

To implement IP rotation/proxies in the load tester, you'll need to:

1. **Set Up Proxy Infrastructure**:

1. Acquire a list of proxy servers (free or paid)
2. Ensure the proxies are compatible with the requests library



2. **Modify the VirtualUser Class**:

1. Add proxy support to the session initialization
2. Implement proxy rotation logic





Here's a sample implementation approach:

```python
class ProxyManager:
    """Class to manage and rotate proxies"""
    
    def __init__(self, proxy_list):
        self.proxies = proxy_list
        self.current_index = 0
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
    
    def get_next_proxy(self):
        """Get the next proxy in the rotation"""
        with self.lock:
            proxy = self.proxies[self.current_index]
            self.current_index = (self.current_index + 1) % len(self.proxies)
            return proxy

# Modify VirtualUser class to use proxies
class VirtualUser:
    def __init__(self, user_id, proxy_manager=None):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.session = requests.Session()
        self.user_agent = random.choice(USER_AGENTS)
        self.session.headers.update({'User-Agent': self.user_agent})
        
        # Apply proxy if available
        if proxy_manager:
            proxy = proxy_manager.get_next_proxy()
            self.session.proxies = {
                'http': proxy,
                'https': proxy
            }
        
        # Rest of initialization...
```

3. **Update the LoadTester Class**:

1. Initialize a ProxyManager with your proxy list
2. Pass the ProxyManager to each VirtualUser



4. **Add Proxy Configuration to the UI**:

1. Add fields to configure proxy settings in the test form
2. Allow uploading a list of proxies



5. **Handle Proxy Failures**:

1. Implement retry logic for failed requests
2. Blacklist proxies that consistently fail





This implementation will distribute requests across multiple IP addresses, helping to avoid rate limiting and IP bans during load testing.

### Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a small number of users and gradually increase
2. **Test in Stages**: Test critical paths individually before combining them
3. **Monitor Server Resources**: Watch server CPU, memory, and network during tests
4. **Use Realistic Data**: Create journeys that simulate real user behavior
5. **Respect Target Systems**: Don't overload production systems without permission
6. **Analyze Results Carefully**: Look for patterns in failures and bottlenecks
7. **Iterate and Refine**: Use test results to improve your application and tests


### Troubleshooting

1. **Test Fails Immediately**:

1. Check that the target URL is accessible
2. Verify your network connection
3. Check for firewall or security restrictions



2. **Low Success Rate**:

1. Check if the target system is rate-limiting requests
2. Verify that selectors in journey steps are correct
3. Increase wait times between steps



3. **Inconsistent Results**:

1. Try running the test multiple times
2. Increase the test duration for more reliable data
3. Check for external factors affecting the target system



4. **High Response Times**:

1. Reduce the number of concurrent users
2. Check server resources during the test
3. Look for database or API bottlenecks





By following this guide, you should be able to effectively use the Load Tester application to test and optimize your web applications under various load conditions.
